** STRATASCRATCH**

1. Calculate the average score for each project, but only include projects where more than one team member has provided a score.
Your output should include the project ID and the calculated average score for each qualifying project.

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
project_data.head()

grouped = project_data.groupby('project_id')

# Counting rows in each group
filtered_data = grouped.filter(lambda x: len(x)>1) 

# Reset index to get project_id as column rather than index
average_score = filtered_data.groupby('project_id')['score'].mean().reset_index()

# Change column name
average_score = average_score.rename(columns={'score':'average_score'})
